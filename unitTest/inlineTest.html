This is a **simple statement in bold** and this is a *simple statement in italic*.
An *emphasized statement* appears differently from a **statement**. Sometimes text
is removed, and then ~~it is deleted~~

This is a non-simple statement that makes use of **strong and _emphasized_** text 
in a layered format.
